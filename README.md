End of Assignment 2 Chapter 3 Comments: The app.js file automatically created didn't not include the route folder and so I had to add additional text and remove a path to the index.js file which is within route. Also heroku foreman no longer exists and the proper line of code is now heroku local not foreman start.

Above is the link for the live app.

This Chapter I didn't commit 4 times because that bit of instructions was at the end and I didn't reach it until I had already finished. In the future I will commit more frequently.

I do however have screenshots throughout the process from using localhost:3000 to localhost:5000 and finally https://sheltered-tundra-14564.herokuapp.com/.
I have included these in my moodle submission.
